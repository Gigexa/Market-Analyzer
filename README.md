# Market-Analyzer
The app allows you to  choose a stock or cryptocurrency and displays 1 month data of the chosen asset along side with EMA and Bollinger band analysis, it also displays the current Bollinger bands positions.

In order for it to function run the MarketCat sript first and it will communicate with Analyzer script after the button "Analyze" interaction.

This is the first version of the script, if I make it executable or add some features will update here.
